The HiLib theme has been meticulously designed to deliver a superior Online Public Access Catalog (OPAC) experience to your SLiMS 9 Senayan library. This modern and user-friendly theme, built for SLiMS v9.6.1, offers a clean design and enhanced functionality. We have refined the main layouts, including the Home, Members, Details and Search pages, to ensure a seamless and intuitive journey for every user, from casual browsers to dedicated researchers and library staff.
